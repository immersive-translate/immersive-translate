## Sponsor my work

I am Owen. I have been working hard to develop an immersive bilingual Web translation extension recently, so the happiest thing recently is to hear user feedback that because of this extension, Ta really fell in love with reading foreign language information.In the past, I myself have also benefited from the free tools developed by countless volunteers, and thus gained too much knowledge that has benefited me for life. This makes me even more convinced that equal access to information is the most right that each of us should have.So I created a lot of free bilingual tools to help people more effectively obtain [huge foreign language information resources] on the Internet (https://www.owenyoung.com/sources /) (At the same time, I also look forward to one day we can get rid of these auxiliary tools)

In <https://www.buzzing.cc /> In this website, I have selected the most reputable media in the English-speaking world (such as the New York Times, The Guardian, the Financial Times, Bloomberg, the Economist, etc.), and forums with high information quality (such as [HackerNews] (https://news.ycombinator.com /), [Reddit Spiritual Food Group] (https://depth.buzzing.cc /), etc.), and other popular social media discussions.I use [Deepl] (https://www.deepl.com/translator ) Translate the title of this information into Chinese (while also retaining the English title for easy comparison), and finally provide a [static page] with good layout, no login, no ads, and no nonsense (https://www.buzzing.cc /) (Support no picture mode to reduce distractions), provides first-class RSS support.

[Immersive Bilingual Web Translation Extension] (https://immersive-translate.owenyoung.com /) Is a tool that I have been working hard to develop recently.This is a browser-based bilingual Web page translation extension that provides a beautifully typeset bilingual Web page translation experience. It can intelligently identify the main content areas of Web pages. At the same time, it is also customized and optimized for some mainstream websites such as Twitter, Reddit, Youtube, etc.This extension supports almost all platforms of browsers, allows users to choose from 10 different translation engines, and also supports out-of-the-box PDF file translation.

I have also created some other free tools, you can click [here] (https://www.owenyoung.com/projects /) Learn about all my projects.

Times are very difficult, and I know that not everyone has the ability to pay for more and more tools and content, so I provide this tool completely free of charge to everyone who needs it.But as an independent developer, the reason why I can continue to do this work is because of the continued generous sponsorship of those who can afford it.This vital support means that thousands of people can continue to use the tools I provide completely free of charge and without ads.So, if you have the ability, I would like to invite you [**Sponsor my work from$1**] (https://immersive-translate.owenyoung.com/donate.html ), thank you very much for your support!
