2. Install this extension of [Oil Monkey Script](https://immersive-translate.owenyoung.com/immersive-translate.user.js ) (Open the link in the Safari browser to see the installation page)
3.

You can also use [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/457196-immersive-translate) to install the Tampermonkey script, but the disadvantage is that iOS [Userscripts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) Tampermonkey extension does not seem to support automatic updates of scripts hosted by Greasyfork, because GreasyFork does not allow the `updateURL` attribute to be filled in.

## Sponsor my work

I am Owen. I have been working hard to develop an immersive bilingual web translation extension recently. The happiest thing for me recently is hearing user feedback that, because of this extension, they have genuinely fallen in love with reading foreign language information. In the past, I have also benefited from the free tools developed by countless volunteers, gaining a wealth of knowledge that has been beneficial throughout my life. This experience has made me even more convinced that equal access to information is a right that each of us should have. So, I created many free bilingual tools to help people more effectively obtain [massive foreign language information resources](https://www.owenyoung.com/sources) on the Internet (At the same time, I also look forward to the day when we can get rid of these auxiliary tools).

On <https://www.buzzing.cc>, I have selected the most reputable media in the English-speaking world (such as the New York Times, The Guardian, the Financial Times, Bloomberg, the Economist, etc.), forums with high information quality (such as [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com), [Reddit Spiritual Food Group](https://depth.buzzing.cc), etc.), and other popular social media discussions. I use [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to translate the titles of this information into Chinese (while also retaining the English title for easy comparison) and finally provide a [static page](https://www.buzzing.cc) with a good layout, no login, no ads, and no nonsense (supporting a no-picture mode to reduce distractions), offering first-class RSS support.

[Immersive Bilingual Web Translation Extension](https://immersive-translate.owenyoung.com) is a tool that I have been working hard to develop recently. This browser-based bilingual web page translation extension provides a beautifully typeset bilingual web page translation experience. It can intelligently identify the main content areas of web pages. Additionally, it is customized and optimized for some mainstream websites such as Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube. This extension supports almost all browser platforms, allows users to choose from 10 different translation engines, and also supports out-of-the-box PDF file translation.

I have also created some other free tools. You can click [here](https://www.owenyoung.com/projects) to learn about all my projects.

Times are very difficult, and I know that not everyone has the ability to pay for more and more tools and content. So, I provide this tool completely free of charge to everyone who needs it. However, as an independent developer, the reason why I can continue to do this work is because of the continued generous sponsorship of those who can afford it. This vital support means that thousands of people can continue to use the tools I provide completely free of charge and without ads. Therefore, if you have the ability, I would like to invite you [**Sponsor my work from $1**](https://immersive-translate.owenyoung.com/donate.html), thank you very much for your support!
